<p class="content">Romeo is a very very cool cat, in which he is someohow cooler then shadow because he doesn't meow and eat all the time :/ He has ran away a few times but came back so I do not know if this is the OG Romeo but he acts the same so :/.
If you do not like Romeo he will come and find you and lick u in the face with his very sharp tongue. He is very shy and very much also a pussy around new people. He also has claws unlike shadow - written by Romeo.</p>
