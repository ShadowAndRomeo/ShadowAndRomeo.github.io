<p class="content">Shadow is an extremely sweet cat; Shadow is sweeter than Romeo because he is more extroverted and friendly to more people. Shadow does meow for food a ton, but that is worth his
sweetness. Shadow is declared so he would have a harder time trying to kill you. He would not kill you, though. Alongside this he has never run away. He is very nice even though he is needy.</p>
